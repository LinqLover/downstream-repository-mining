This project was created as a student project for the course "Software Mining and Applications" offered by the Computer Graphics System Group ([@hpicgs](https://github.com/hpicgs)/[@varg-dev](https://github.com/varg-dev)) at the Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI), Potsdam, Germany, and run by Christoph Thiede ([@LinqLover](https://github.com/LinqLover)).

Furthermore, this project wouldn't have been possible without:

- Continuous mentoring by Daniel Limberger ([@cgcostume](https://github.com/cgcostume)) and Willy Scheibel ([@scheibel](https://github.com/scheibel))
- Support by Tomer Aberbach ([TomerAberbach](https://github.com/TomerAberbach)) for fixing a combination of module import problems for `parse-imports` (see [#38](https://github.com/LinqLover/downstream-repository-mining/pull/38))
- All the dependencies declared in [package.json](./package-json)
